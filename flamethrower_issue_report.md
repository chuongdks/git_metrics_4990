## Issue #27: Integrating a ci pipeline into the project
* **URL:** https://github.com/fireship-io/flamethrower/issues/27
* **Labels:** 

### Description
**What about integrating a ci pipeline into the project?**
In this way, we could automate the process of checking that the new changes are breaking the codebase or not.
I think that a Github Actions pipeline would fit well here.
